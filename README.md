# crypto_tools
Small collection of cryptographic-related libraries that I create to learn cryptography and solve some hacking challenges.

For the AES code, I mostly reused the code from Bo Zhu (https://github.com/bozhu/AES-Python), because it was exactly what I wanted to write, but better and clearer.

**Disclaimer**

Of course, this code shall not be used in real cryptographic applications. They exist only for learning purpose.
